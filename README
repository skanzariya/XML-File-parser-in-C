a XML File parser

What is it?
A simple xml config file parser in C, Normally we use .ini or key=value based config file for our daemon/program, Here I have tried to keep xml as a config file, Because we found xml supports in almost all other language, so we can use the value in other program/application.

How to install
gcc -Wall -O2 -o Parser parser.c `xml2-config --cflags --libs`

Hot to use it
./Parser config.xml

ADD...
You can modify the source code and use it the way you want.
